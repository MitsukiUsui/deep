# What's this?
Various deep learning algorithms implemented in TensorFlow.

## Algorithms
### MNIST
This is a tutorial for image processing.
4 different implementation are provided [here](https://github.com/MitsukiUsui/deep/tree/master/mnist/mymodels), together with simple k-NN neighbor.

0. Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) without TensorFlow
0. MLP with Tensorflow
0. Stacked Denoising Autoencoder + MLP (comming soon)
0. Convolutional neural network (CNN)

The accuracy of those 4 (+1) programs can be evaluated on a same interface. Please refer to <https://github.com/MitsukiUsui/deep/blob/master/mnist/score_models.ipynb>

### Image processing

### RNN

## Environment

```
(installation of pyenv)
(installation of anaconda3-??)
pip install upgrade tensorflow
```
